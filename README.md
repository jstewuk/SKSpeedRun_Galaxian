Code for my talk "Speed Run: Build a Galaxian Clone with SpriteKit in 45 Minutes"

SpriteKit is a terrific new 2D game engine that Apple gave developers with iOS 7
and improved in iOS 8. In this crash course, we'll build a clone of the classic 
arcade game Galaxian in a mere 45 minutes. We'll see not only how to create and
use sprites, but also take advantage of SpriteKit's sound effects, particle 
editor and generator, and physics engine. And when we're done creating the
game on iOS, for extra credit we'll build it for the Mac too with almost no 
extra code.

Props to Sean McMains, the creative genius behind this!
